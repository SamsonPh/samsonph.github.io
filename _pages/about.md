Hi, welcome to my world. I am a freelance AI researcher and I am working in Natural Language Processing. I also know a bit about image processing and signal processing. I like to challenge myself and explore new technological challenges. I'm a boring man. (I heard someone say that I'm not boring at all.)

News and Updates
======
## 2025
- 15/08/2025: I officially concluded my nearly 5-year journey with the mission of "Vietnamese Technology for a Vietnamese Future" at VinBigData. Farewell, VinBigData.
- 08/08/2025: Alongside my team and colleagues at VinBigData, we successfully integrated and demonstrated a specialized language and interaction model for two humanoid robots: Vin-Kong (by VinRobotics) and VinMotion Motion One (by VinMotion). These two new entities within Vingroup are dedicated to humanoid robotics and are poised to become a highlight in the development of intelligent humanoid robots in Vietnam.
- 01/01/2025: I transitioned from my role in the Natural Language Processing department to build and lead my own team in the field of Physical AI. Our focus is on developing Human-Machine Interaction (HRI) and Visual Language Action models (VLA) for intelligent humanoid robots. I believe this will be the next frontier in artificial intelligence and modern human-robot interaction.
